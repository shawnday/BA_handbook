# Technical Requirements

The course Twitter and Instagram hashtag is #UCCDH.

This course is all about the digital. You will be doing hands-on projects, assignments and developing a critical appreciation of public participation in the digitally-enabled sphere. To facilitate this please acquire a ‘Domain of your Own’. We avail ourselves of an
academically-focussed service provider: Reclaim Hosting (http://reclaimhosting.com)

Please choose a domain name and buy a year of full web hosting services at:
http://reclaimhosting.com

Choosing a domain name can be important, but is not a life or death choice right now - you need an online presence for this programme, but you may at some later date decide to ‘rebrand’ and move some or all of your content to a new domain name.  If you are lucky enough to get a good domain name right off, hold onto it; but equally be willing to work with something less than perfect for now. As we move through the programme, you will develop a much better grasp of domain name choice and its importance.

Once you complete the signup process you will be sent registration information allowing you to log into and configure your own web applications. We will providing a workshop on cPanel for those who have not had previous experience using it. Please note that if you already are using a shared service or have an existing domain, we ask that you acquire this additional service so that we all work on a common platform.
