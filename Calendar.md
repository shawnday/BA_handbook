## Deadlines

It is important that you understand that as this is a professional programme, deadlines are deadlines and are not flexible. Module descriptions list penalties for late submission, and these will be applied. The late penalties may be reduced if and only if you have medical or other issues which are covered by a medical cert, issued in accordance with the University Guidelines: https://www.ucc.ie/en/registration/certs/. The originals of such certificates must be lodged in the DH office, and they will be considered by the course team at the internal exam board. This is in the interests of consistency and fairness for all students.
