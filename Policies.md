# Policies & Guidelines

## Submission & Feedback Guidelines

All assignment submitted for modules in Digital Humanities must be have a cover sheet attached containing the following information: Programme Name, Module Number and Name, Title of the Assignment, Student Name & Number, Date, Lecturer and URL (if applicable). A template is available at: https://uccdh.com/wordpressSite/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DAH-Assignment-Cover-Sheet.docx

When your instructor has assessed your work you will be notified that feedback is available from the DH Office. There you can request a printed copy of feedback and a provisional mark on the assessment.

Any marks provided during semester are provisional until they are confirmed by both  the external assessor for the course and the UCC Examination Board.

## Backups and Security

You are also responsible for keeping copies of your digital work for the course. There are many ways to do this – many students use College email to email copies of work  to themselves,  there are several online services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, Evernote and Zotero which offer a level of free storage.  USB keys are now relatively cheap. Most of these options will certainly provide enough space to store as much text as you will deal with during the year, but large media files will need more space. Work out a backup and “Business Continuity Plan” for your work that works for you. Have backups in several clearly separate and distinct places/services so that if one fails, the other(s) are safe.
The “internet ate my homework” will not be acceptable as an excuse in this course!

## Research Ethics

The Discipline of Digital Humanities are committed to ensure that all research carried out under its auspices meets the highest ethical standards while taking account of the law and the public interest. We adhere to the The European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity (https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/other/hi/h2020-ethics_code-of-conduct_en.pdf).

When conducting your Final Year Project your research may require the completion of the UCC Digital Humanities Social Research Ethics approval process. This will be determined in consultation with your supervisor. If required complete the DH SRE Form available at:  https://uccdh.com/dh-sre-applicationformv1june2018/

This form will be submitted directly to your supervisor. It is the responsibility of the student to be in touch with their supervisor and determine whether an ethics review process is necessary.

## Attendance

Attendance is mandatory at all lectures and labs. The only acceptable exception to this is a recognised medical certificate. If you have to be absent please notify your instructor to make arrangements for getting appropriate information and lecture notes. This is your responsibility. Medical certificates must be submitted to the DH office.

## Privacy: Private and Public Spaces

A successful online learning community requires trusted spaces for free ranging critical discussions. We also need to produce finished work which reaches a quality suitable for public use. This requires thoughtful engagement with the private, semi-public and public spaces in which we work. The course team also engage in active research on digital pedagogy; as indeed should the students; our learning is the raw material for our research on how we learn.

There are no hard and fast rules as tools and methods evolve constantly, but we are all now creators of data which includes other people’s personally identifiable information. Therefore, in general:
Emails inside the class should be treated as privileged and not shared without proper consideration.

Discussions within the Blackboard LMS should be regarded as being private,and subject to the Chatham House Rule. This is:
"When a meeting, or part thereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed“.

UCC staff email may be subject to FOI where it relates to administration or examinations; Blackboard content may be used for teaching quality reviews by the university; this would be subject to the prevailing FOI and Data Protection legislation.

We use other platforms, outside Blackboard, for explorations and learning in digital cultures. We do not control those and there should be no expectation of privacy in ‘the digital wild’.

We do expect that final work will be of a quality worthy of public presentation.

The learning process will therefore move through different spaces, with different expectations of privacy, and part of your learning in this programme includes developing thoughtful awareness of private and public ‘spaces’ in the digital world.

## University Policies

It is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with university policies pertaining to the UCC experience. They are designed to ensure your success and to maximise the experience of your programme cohort.

University College Cork Student Guidelines and policies are detailed at: https://www.ucc.ie/en/students/policies/

## Integrity

This is a professional program, and participants are expected to behave professionally, working in a timely way, collaborating and treating others with dignity and respect and honesty. The collaborative nature of our learning, which reflects the teamwork essential in the contemporary workplace, demands a degree of care, courtesy and respect for diversity. Breaches of these norms may be penalised, up to and including grading penalties.

## Grade Descriptors

These are the National University of Ireland Grade Descriptors. Work you submit to this programme will be judged according to these criteria.
