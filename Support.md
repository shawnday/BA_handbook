# Disability Support Services

Any student who, because of a disability, may require special arrangements in order to meet the course requirements should contact the instructor as soon as possible to make necessary arrangements. Students should present appropriate verification from Disability Support Services (DSS) during the instructorâ€™s office hours. 
**Please note**: Instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodations to a student until appropriate verification from DSS has been provided.
